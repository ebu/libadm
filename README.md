## Introduction

The `libadm` library is a modern C++11 library to parse, modify, create and
write [`ITU-R BS.2076`](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2076) conformant XML. It works well with the header-only
library [`libbw64`](https://github.com/ebu/libbw64) to write ADM
related applications with minimal dependencies.

[Read the documentation](https://libadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get
started.

## Features

- minimal dependencies
- expressive syntax
- easy access to referenced ADM elements
- common definitions support

## Dependencies

- compiler with C++11 support
- Boost header libraries (version 1.57 or later)
  - Boost.Optional
  - Boost.Variant
  - Boost.Range
  - Boost.Iterator
  - Boost.Functional
  - Boost.Format
- CMake build system (version 3.5 or later)

## Installation

### macOS
On macOS you can use homebrew to install the library. You just have to add the NGA homebrew tap and can then use the usual install command.

```
brew tap ebu/homebrew-nga
brew install libadm
```

### Manual installation
To manually install the library you have to clone the git repository and then use the CMake build system to build and install it.

```
git clone git@github.com:ebu/libadm.git
cd libadm
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

## CMake
As the library uses CMake as a build system it is really easy to set up and use if your project does too. Assuming you have installed the library, the following code shows a complete CMake example to compile a program which uses the libadm.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(libadm_example VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(adm REQUIRED)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE adm)
```

If you prefer not to install the library on your system you can also use the library as a subproject. You can just add the library as a CMake subproject. Just add the folder containing the repository to your project and you can use the adm target.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(libadm_example VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

add_subdirectory(submodules/libadm)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE adm)
```

#### Note

If `libadm` is used as a CMake subproject the default values of the options

- `ADM_UNIT_TESTS`
- `ADM_EXAMPLES`
- `ADM_PACKAGE_AND_INSTALL`

are automatically set to `FALSE`.

## Example

The following minimal example shows how easy a valid ADM file can be created
from scratch using the `libadm` library. For more examples have a look at the
[examples folder](examples) in the repository.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <adm/adm.hpp>
#include <adm/utilities/object_creation.hpp>
#include <adm/write.hpp>

int main() {
  using namespace adm;

  // create ADM elements
  auto admProgramme = AudioProgramme::create(AudioProgrammeName("Alice and Bob talking"));
  auto speechContent = AudioContent::create(AudioContentName("Speech"));
  auto aliceHolder = createSimpleObject("Alice");
  auto bobHolder = createSimpleObject("Bob");

  // add references
  admProgramme->addReference(speechContent);
  speechContent->addReference(aliceHolder.audioObject);
  speechContent->addReference(bobHolder.audioObject);

  auto admDocument = Document::create();
  admDocument->add(admProgramme);

  // write XML data to stdout
  writeXml(std::cout, admDocument);
  return 0;
}
```

## Current Limitations
It can take time for revisions to Rec. ITU-R BS.2076 to be incorporated into this library. The implementation of the library might not include all possible uses of all the Recommendation.

The areas that are currently unsupported include:
1. Some ADM sub-elements are missing
2. There is no SADM support (ITU-R BS.2125)
